# Dataset of IoT-Based Energy and Environmental Parameters in a Smart Building Infrastructure

## Overview
Data were collected using IoT sensors deployed throughout the M5 building of our institution. This dataset encompasses both energy consumption data from various devices and environmental data from key locations within the building.

## Data Collection
- **Devices**: Energy data were recorded from appliances such as coffee machines, microwaves, etc.
- **Locations**: Environmental data were captured in key areas including the Interdisciplinary lab, kitchen, and mail room.

## Sensors Used
- **Energy Consumption Meters**: Measure the power usage of various devices.
- **Temperature and Humidity Sensors**: Monitor environmental conditions.
- **Occupancy Sensors**: Detect the presence of individuals in different areas.

## Usage
This data is intended for research on energy efficiency, environmental monitoring, and building management systems.
